This meticulously documented workflow provides a robust framework for performing unsupervised classification using ENVI and subsequent cartographic refinement in ArcMap. This comprehensive process, from initial image acquisition and classification in ENVI to the nuanced reclassification and symbology adjustments in ArcMap, was systematically applied to satellite imagery of Kericho, Kenya, spanning the years 1985, 1995, 2005, 2015, and 2025. The resulting Land Use/Land Cover maps serve as invaluable tools for monitoring environmental changes, urban expansion, and agricultural dynamics over time within the region.
